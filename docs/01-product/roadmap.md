# Roadmap

## Purpose

This is a PRD-aligned list of planned improvements for repo-slice.

## Near-term

- Strict symbol matching (`--symbol-strict`) and better ambiguity handling
- Expanded log parsing beyond tsc/pytest
- JSON output snapshots and end-to-end fixture tests

## Mid-term

- Smarter Python reference resolution (semantic analysis)
- Token budgeting with a real tokenizer
- Enhanced framework detection and scoring boosts

## Longer-term

- Profile support (named configuration sets)
- Delta mode output (changed-only bundles)
